Can select individual shape and do one of the multiple operations.
Can also do all of a certain operation applied to every shape.
Or do all operations applied to all shapes.


Each shape has a certain unique coordinate / tile.
These are the args of the Fundamental Domain.

Each shape also has an operation which moves it to another tile position.
The simplest is a translation which simply moves a rhombus around.
(0,0) is the rhombus in the middle.
